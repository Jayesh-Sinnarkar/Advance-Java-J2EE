2.2 Refer to welcome page : login.jsp 
n trace complete flow .

3. MANDATORY requirement for tomorrow.
Lab faculties , please help students here.
3.1 Copy "day7-data\code\test_hibernate_basic" under your workspace folder.

3.2 import test_hibernate_basic , as existing Maven project in your workspace.
(Lab Faculties will demo this. You simply follow. )
You will need internet connection here.
Hibernate dependencies (jar files) will get downloaded from net, to your machine.
Reference pic : "day7-data\hibernate maven dependencies.png"
Your project SHOULD have all of these dependencies downloaded.
I have not yet explained anything on Maven. Will be done later.
Today just keep the JARs downloaded.

4. After finishing earlier steps   , complete pending work.


Day 8
1. DO NOT import any of today's projects first.
Since all of you are going to create hibernate project from scratch.

1.1 Copy test_hibernate_basic , into day8_hibernate_lab
Edit project name n artifact id

1.2 Force update the project
R Click on project --Maven --Update Project (Force update it!)

1.3 If you are having problems still , in downloading the Maven hibernate dependencies , 
Use Maven clean option(Take lab faculty's help)

1.4 Worst case : delete maven <repository> n rebuild the same
AVOID this !

2. MANDATORY assignment , to be solved with the lab faculty help
2.1 Confirm bootstrapping of hibernate project (SessionFactory creation with hibernate utils n tester)
2.2 Create Student pojo 
properties : 
 studentId : Integer (PK) ,first name , last name,email,password,confirmPassword,course(enum), admission fees (double) ,dob : LocalDate , profilePic : byte[] 

Add JPA annotations
Add <mapping> entry
Test proper creation of "students" table.
Refer to our Employee POJO for annotations.

3. MANDATORY assignment , to be solved with the lab faculty help
Table : users2 
Register new voter 
create a new dynamic web project (day8_lab_web)
JSP --JavaBean --(JDBC based )DAO --DBUtils--POJO 
(You can copy from earlier DAO , POJO n utils Layers)
YOu should write User Java bean from scratch
Flow : welcome page  -- index.jsp 
Add A link : Register new voter  (details to be added in : users2 table)
register.jsp (registration form)
--submit the form to process_reg_form.jsp
Use JavaBean n DAO n insert the record in DB , for new user
1 Validation rule : voter's age > 21

Day 9
1. import day9.1 in your workspace as existing maven project
1.1 Modify hibernate.cfg.xml , as per your db username n password

1.2 Force update the project
R Click on project --Maven --Update Project (Force update it!)

1.3 Revise create(save) , get , JPQL , with IN params , update operations , in 1st hour of the lab session.
Tip : Revise it in a top down manner
Open the testers (test cases) one by one n trace the entire flow.

2. Mandatory assignment
Continue with your : day8_hibernate_lab (where you already have Student POJO , hibernate utils n TestHibernate.java)
DO NOT create a new project , un necessarily

Solve this
1. Student registration
i/p : student details (first name , last name,email,password,confirmPassword,course(enum), admission fees (double) ,dob )
o/p : Reg successful , with student id(auto generated from hibernate) 
or failure mesg.

2. Student login
i/p : email , password
o/p : login successful , with student details lifted from db
or failure mesg.

3. Get all students from a specific course
i/p : course name
o/p : display list of students from the course
Hint : Course c=Course.valueOf(...);
String jpql="select s from Student s where s.chosenCourse=:course";
List<Student> students=session.createQuery(jpql,Student.class).setParameter("course",c).getResultList();

4. Offer scholarship to a particular  student
i/p : student id , scholarship amount
o/p : in case of invalid id --error mesg
in case of success : reduce admission fees by the scholarship amount n display student details


Day 10

1. import day10.1 to revise , Hibernate CRUD, bulk operations , JPA constructor expression,image handling

2. import day10.2 to revise , introduction to 
2.1 Inheritance : @MappedSuperclass
2.2 one to many bi dir association between entities

Try out as discussed Author  1<---->* Book

3. Complete earlier pending work.


Day 11
1. Check if you have day10_lab (your own project, with Author n Book)
If yes continue with the same. 
If not import day10_lab , from day10_data.

Revise : mappedBy
Add : cascading , orphan removal , helper methods to add/remove child

Solve 
1.1 Add Author with 2 books
i/p : author details
2 book details
Confirm cascading
(1 rec in authors + 2 recs in books table should be inserted : cascade on save 
+ FKs auto assigned)

1.2 Delete author details
i/p : author id
(author n book recs should be deleted : This will confirm cascade on delete)

1.3 Add only author details
i/p : author details
(1 rec in authors table : inserted)

1.4 Publish a new book for specified author
i/p : author email (unique)
1 book details
(1 rec in books table : inserted + FK auto assigned)


1.5 Display author details
i/p : email
Try to display author details , it should work with correct email.
Try to display associated book  details , it should throw , which exception ?
How will you fix it ?
(Later we will use join)
Today simply try with eager fetch type


1.6 Remove book from specific author
i/p : author id n book id


2. In individual labs :
Integrate web app + hibernate
(import template project : web_maven_hibernate)
I hope it's already done!
Layers : JSP --Java Bean --Hibernate based DAO --HibernateUtils --Entities --DB

Solve :
Assume you already have the author rec inserted in DB
Add a book to existing author
index.jsp --> add_book.jsp --> process_form.jsp --> status.jsp
(validation rule : publish date must be in the current year)

add_book.jsp : a form 
i/ps :author email , book title , book publish date

status.jsp : should display the status (success / failure)

Think : When will you like to load hibernate frmwork (connection pool . SF ) , at web app dep time OR after 1st clnt request ?

How will you achieve it ?
Will be discussed in the lab.


Day 12

NO new mandatory assignments
Let's revise entity -entity associations today. Value types tomorrow!

1. import day12.1 , to revise 
session.get vs session.load

2. import day12.2 , to revise 
one-one : uni dir mapping
many-many : bi dir mapping

Above  will be done in a combined  lab.


Optional : for practice

1. Assign address to existing emp
i/p : emp id , adr details(Address adr)

2. Add new emp + adr details
i/p : emp dtls + adr dtls

3. Get adr details of a specific emp
i/p : emp email

4. Get all emps from a specific city
i/p : city

Later practice many-many also.
